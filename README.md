# DodgeBatt
This is a 1v1 VR+LeapMotion game designed during the UMD Bitcamp 2016 hackathon using Oculus Rift, LeapMotion, and Unity.

Two players stand on opposite sides of a big room floating in space. They smack comets and asteroids at each other using bats, and block oncoming attacks using a shield. The comets and asteroids (colelctively called "balls") aren't affected by any gravity, and they bounce off of the walls of the room until either one of them colides with a player or a player swings a bat at them. 

More info coming soon!
